# assembly-hackathon
Information about Accumulate's first hackathon and ideas for software to build.

**What is Accumulate?**\
[Accumulate](https://accumulatenetwork.io) is a high-performance blockchain for DeFi, integrating blockchains, protocols, oracles, and applications, serving as a bridge for the new digital economy. Accumulate shifts the paradigm for how blockchains manage data, tokens, and users with an identity-based, Proof-of-Stake blockchain offering secure, scalable, and extensible features to power DeFi applications.\ 

**Hackathon:**\
Accumulate is a brand-new protocol and we welcome all projects that utilize Accumulate in some way. We are particularly interested in three types of projects.

* Tools that make it easier for developers to develop on Accumulate

* Projects that help users to interact with Accumulate

* Decentralized applications developed on Accumulate
